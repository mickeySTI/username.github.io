  <h2>About Me</h2>
<p id="firstPara">Hello my name is Michael Garcia! I am 26 years old, live in Clevend, OH, and I currently attend We Can Code It with the goal of becoming a software developer. I started coding while I was in college pursuing a degree in electrical engineering. The first "Hello World" I wrote was displayed on an LCD screen of a microprocessor called Arduino. I have been hooked on coding ever since. I went the self-teaching route for about 2 years, learning from courses on Udemy, and from tutorials on Youtube. I have worked with Python,  HTML, CSS, and Java so far. Programming has brougt out the creativeness in me and has been a great craft to learn!</p><a name="aboutme"></a>
